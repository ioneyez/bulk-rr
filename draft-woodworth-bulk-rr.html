<p id="rfc.section.1.p.1">The BULK DNS resource record defines a pattern-based method for on-the-fly resource record generation.  It is essentially an enhanced wildcard mechanism, constraining generated resource record owner names to those that match a pattern of variable numeric substrings.  It is also akin to the $GENERATE master file directive <a href="#bind-arm" class="xref">[bind-arm]</a> without being limited to numeric values and without creating all possible records in the zone data.</p>

Note that query type ANY will select all Match Types, and all query types match a CNAME Match Type [ and DNAME? ].  One or more answer RRs will be generated per the replacement rules below.

<p id="rfc.section.3.2.p.3">The next form of reference notation uses the asterisk, "<em>".  With ${</em>}, all captured values in order of ascending position, delimited by its default delimiter (described below), are placed in the answer.</p>

[ Earlier drafts attempted to make the default delimiter context-dependent, such as by using a period for A requests and a colon for AAAA requests.

This can be a handy feature in the IPv6 reverse namespace where every nibble is captured as a separate value and generated hostnames include sets of 4 nibbles.

<p id="rfc.section.3.2.3.p.3">If a delimiter interval greater than 1 is used, captured values between the intervals will be concatenated and the padding or unpadding applied as a unit and not individually.

<p id="rfc.section.4.3.p.1">[ This section needs reworking still, and should perhaps be pulled out into a separate document.  Notably one of issues that is not really described well is that, as designed so far, at signing time the NPN record has to be associated with the matching BULK record, which is slightly problematic with regard to the idea that NPNs are suggested to be extended to be used in the future with other patterns-based record generation.  Once the appropriate BULK record is selected, the signer would then have to understand its semantics to fake up the exemplar to sign &#8211; raising the question as to why it doesn't also know the appropriate values for the Ignore fields, since it will have to understand what the static and variable parts are.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.4.3.p.2">One way around all this is to just sign the BULK record itself and return it in the additional section along with the answer, so that the resolver could validate not only a signature but the resulting record based on the substitution algorithm.  It'd still be problematic for older DNSSEC validators that don't grok BULK, but no more so than not grokking NPN. Unfortunately to them in both cases the type-appropriate answer itself will be unsigned and thus fail validation. ]</p>
<p id="rfc.section.4.3.p.3">This document provides a minor yet significant modification to DNSSEC regarding how RRsets will be signed or verified.  Specifically the Signature Field of <a href="#RFC4034" class="xref">[RFC4034]</a>, Section 3.1.8.  Prior to processing into canonical form, signed zones may contain associated RRs where; owner, class and type of a non NPN RR directly corresponds with an NPN RR matching owner, class and Match Type.  If this condition exists the NPN RR's RDATA defines details for processing the associated RDATA into a "Normalized" format.  Normalized data is based on pre-canonical formatting and zero padded for "A" and "AAAA" RR types for acceptable precision during the process.  This concept will become clearer in the NPN pseudocode and examples provided in the sections to follow.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.4.3.p.4">The rules for this transformation are simple:</p>
<p></p>

<ul>
<li>For RR's Owner field, characters from the beginning to the index of the Owner Ignore value or the final string of characters belonging to the zone's ORIGIN MUST NOT be modified by this algorithm.  While the Owner Ignore value is not used for BULK records but is included with the expectation other pattern-based resource records may emerge and leverage NPN records for their DNSSEC support requirements.</li>
<li>For RR's RDATA field, character from beginning to the index of Left Ignore value or characters with index of Right Ignore value to the end MUST NOT be modified by this algorithm.</li>
<li>In the remaining portion of both Owner and RDATA strings of numeric data, defined as character "0" through "f" or "0" through "9" depending on whether or not the Hexadecimal flag is set or not, MUST be consolidated to a single character and set to the highest value defined by the Hexadecimal flag.  Examples may be found in the following section.  If period-as-number or hyphen-as-number flags are set whichever are used ("." or "-") would be treated as part of the number and consolidated where appropriate.</li>
</ul>
<p id="rfc.section.4.3.p.6">Once the normalization has been performed the signature will continue processing into canonical form using the normalized RRs in the place of original ones.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.4.3.p.7">NPN RRs MAY be included in the "Additional" section to provide a hint of the NPN processing required for the verification path.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.4.3.p.8">It is important to note, properly sizing the Ignore fields is critical to minimizing the risk of spoofed signatures.  Never intentionally set all Ignore values to zero in order to make validation easier as it places the validity of zone data at risk.

<p id="rfc.section.5.1.p.2">On the resolver side, rolling out a new semantics in DNSSEC has also proven to be difficult in the past.

<p id="rfc.section.6.p.1">Two known security considerations exist for the BULK resource record, DNSSEC and DDOS attack vectors.</p>
<h1 id="rfc.section.6.1">
<a href="#rfc.section.6.1">6.1.</a> <a href="#dnssec-signature-strategies" id="dnssec-signature-strategies">DNSSEC Signature Strategies</a>
</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.6.1.p.1">DNSSEC was designed to provide validation for DNS resource records.  In a nutshell this requires each (owner, class, type) tuple to have its own signature.  This essentially defeats the purpose of providing large generated blocks of RRs in a single RR as each generated RR would require its own legitimate RRSIG record.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.6.1.p.2">In the following sections several options are discussed to address this issue.  Of the options, on-the-fly provides the most secure solution and NPN provides the most flexible.</p>
<h1 id="rfc.section.6.1.1">
<a href="#rfc.section.6.1.1">6.1.1.</a> <a href="#on-the-fly-signatures" id="on-the-fly-signatures">On-the-fly Signatures</a>
</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.6.1.1.p.1">This solution requires authoritative nameservers to sign generated records as they are created.  Not all authoritative nameserver implementations offer on-the-fly signatures, and even with those that do not all operators will want to keep signing keys online, so this solution would either require all implementations to support on-the-fly signing or be ignored by implementations which can not or will not comply.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.6.1.1.p.2">No changes to validating resolvers is required to support this solution.</p>
<h1 id="rfc.section.6.1.2">
<a href="#rfc.section.6.1.2">6.1.2.</a> <a href="#normalized-npn-based-signatures" id="normalized-npn-based-signatures">Normalized (NPN-Based) Signatures</a>
</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.6.1.2.p.1">This solution provides the most flexible solution as nameservers without on-the-fly signing capabilities can still support signatures for BULK records.  The down side to this solution is it requires additional DNSSEC-aware resolver support.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.6.1.2.p.2">It has been pointed out that due to this limitation, creation of DNSSEC-signed BULK RRs requiring NPN support SHOULD be formally discouraged until such time a respectable percentage (&gt;80%) of validating resolvers in-the-wild possess NPN processing capabilities.  Until that time, on-the-fly signing and unsigned records offer the intended capabilities of the BULK specification, while requiring zero new features to support RR resolution. The authors would like to encourage opening this door for pattern based technologies such as NPN records as a solution to BULK RRs as well as other pattern based RRs to come. Given enough time, enough nameservers will be patched and upgraded for unrelated reasons and by means of simple attrition can supply a level of inertia and eventually widespread adoption can be assumed.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.6.1.2.p.3">NPN records are likely to be a topic of great debate as to their own security limitations.  It is, however, the authors' belief that while any logic which limits the input of digital signatures lessens the validity of those signatures, the limitation is minimal and the gain is significant.  The main reason for this is as a general rule, RRs used in a generic manner such as conventional $GENERATE RRs or scripted mass pattern generated RRs have a lesser importance than other RRs in managed zones.  These therefore inherently pose less risk by means of attack and have a much less reward by defeating security measures.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.6.1.2.p.4">This being said, care must still be taken to set the Ignore fields appropriately to minimize exposure and only use NPN RRs to secure pattern-based records such as BULK.</p>

<p id="rfc.section.6.1.3.p.1">As a final option zones which wish to remain entirely without DNSSEC support may serve such zones without either of the above solutions and records generated based on BULK RRs will require zero support from recursive (resolving) nameservers.</p>

<p id="rfc.section.6.2.p.1">Verification of DNSSEC signed BULK generated RRs may be performed against on-the-fly signatures with zero modification to their behavior.  However, verification using NPN records would require changes to the logic to incorporate processing RDATA generated by BULK logic as described above so the results will be compatible.</p>

While this document uses 24 hours (86400 seconds) in its examples, values between 300 to 900 seconds are likely more appropriate and is RECOMMENDED.

<p id="rfc.section.B.3.p.3">This example illustrates a key point about NPN records; since they are pre-canonical they MUST operate on a strict subset of WIRE formatted data.  For A and AAAA records this means the "Ignore" fields are based on zero padded data.  In this example our generated record MUST be converted into "010.002.003.044" (shown above) prior to processing.  After processing, wire format would become "0x0A02032C" (shown in hexadecimal).  This format would be too imprecise for normalization so padded decimal is used.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.B.3.p.4">Everything to the left of "003.044" will remain intact as will everything to its right.  The remaining characters will be processed for digits between 0 and 9 as indicated by the NPN record's hexadecimal flag "9" and each run replaced by the single character "9".  The final Normalized RDATA would therefore become 10.2.9.9 and its signature would be based on this normalized RDATA field. This new normalized A RR would be used as an RDATA for the wildcard label of "<em>.example.com." now encompassing all possible permutations of the 10.2.${</em>} pattern.</p>

<p id="rfc.section.B.4.p.3">This example reinforces the point on pre-canonical processing of NPN records; they MUST operate on a strict subset of WIRE formatted data.
