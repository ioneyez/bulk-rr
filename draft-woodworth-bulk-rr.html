<p id="rfc.section.1.p.1">The BULK DNS resource record defines a pattern-based method for on-the-fly resource record generation.  It is essentially an enhanced wildcard mechanism, constraining generated resource record owner names to those that match a pattern.  It is also akin to the $GENERATE master file directive (FIXME insert ref to ISC Bv9ARM.ch06.html), without being limited to numeric values and without creating all possible records in the zone data.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.1.p.2">For example, consider the following record:</p>
<pre>
*.example.com. 86400 IN BULK A (
                         pool-A-[0-255]-[0-255].example.com.

For Match Type "A" the default delimiter SHALL be a period ".", for Match Type "AAAA" the default delimiter SHALL be a colon ":" and for Match Types "PTR" and "CNAME" the default delimiter SHALL be a hyphen "-". In any case the default delimiter MAY be overridden by including it in the reference braces after the set selectors and a reference field separator character, the pipe "|".  An example would be "${<em>|-}" which would force a hyphen "-" delimiter.  An empty or null delimiter is allowed by not specifying a delimiter character, for example "${</em>|}", which would simply concatenate all captured values in order of capture position.

To allow captured references to be delimited at another interval a third reference field is provided.  An example would be "${*|-|4}" which would concatenate all captured values but delimiting only every fourth value with hyphens "-".  This can be a handy feature in the IPv6 reverse namespace where every nibble is captured as a separate value and generated hostnames include sets of 4 nibbles.

<p id="rfc.section.3.2.1.1.7.p.1">When generating BULK based records a common requirement is to convert from one numeric format to another, padding is among the most common of these.  The fourth and final reference field determines what width to pad to.  An example would be "${<em>|||4}" which would set the width of all captured values to 4 by inserting leading zeros to fill the void.  The default is empty or null which MUST be interpreted as NO modification.  A width of zero "0" has a special interpretation referred to as "unpad" meaning all leading zeros MUST be removed.  If a value is provided captured values longer than this width MUST be truncated to fit the specified width.  In the case where a delimiter interval is provided captured values between the intervals will be concatenated and the padding or unpadding applied as a unit and not individually.  An example of this would be "${</em>||4|4}" which would combine each range of 4 captured values and pad them to a width of 4 characters by inserting leading zeros where necessary.</p>

<p id="rfc.section.3.2.1.1.8.p.1">Great effort has gone into providing zone maintainers an intuitive syntax.  As part of this effort, the captured values will reverse direction depending on several factors.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.3.2.1.1.8.p.2">As a general rule of thumb, if it makes sense the numeric ranges are in reverse order from query to answer then they will be reversed. Otherwise they will be in the same order.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.3.2.1.1.8.p.3">Take for example a simple reverse DNS lookup, from "10.2.3.4" to "pool-A-3-4.example.com.".  Since DNS zones are arranged according to management authority the records appear reversed numerically. In this example "10.2.3.4" becomes "4.3.2.10.in-addr.arpa.". One would intuitively expect this reversal to be reversed so positional indices of captured values would increment toward the right of the Replacement Pattern.  This expectation is especially important when using range based replacements.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.3.2.1.1.8.p.4">Formally, the rules for position reversal are as follows:</p>
<p id="rfc.section.3.2.1.1.8.p.5">Match Type RRs for "PTR" are reversed for zone owners ending in either ".in-addr.arpa." or "ip6.arpa.".  All other Match Type RRs for "PTR" are forward.</p>

<p id="rfc.section.3.2.2.p.1">This section provides examples of several BULK RR Replacement Patterns.  Each example is intended to further understanding for implementers and DNS administrators alike.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.3.2.2.p.2">EXAMPLE 1 For this example the query is defined as a PTR record for "10.2.3.4" with an origin of "2.10.in-addr.arpa." and the evaluating BULK RR as:</p>
<pre>
    - 86400 IN BULK PTR - pool-${*}.example.com.
</pre>
<p id="rfc.section.3.2.2.p.3">This example contains several of the features described above.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.3.2.2.p.4">First, the record owner is simply a single hyphen "-" denoting it is a "hidden wildcard" (wildcard for generated records but not for BULK).</p>
<p id="rfc.section.3.2.2.p.5">Second, the Domain Name Pattern is also a single hyphen "-" denoting all queries matching the owner's wildcard pattern for the "PTR" Match Type are accepted and will be captured for use in the Replacement Pattern.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.3.2.2.p.6">Third, the Replacement Pattern contains a single "star" reference denoting all captured numeric (decimal) references will be combined with its default delimiter of hyphen "-" (for PTR) and placed into the reference's position in the answer-set.  Should this generate an invalid hostname the response will be NXDOMAIN unless other BULK records match and are successfully generated without error.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.3.2.2.p.7">The owner for "10.2.3.4" is "4.3.2.10.in-addr.arpa." and creates matching references for "4", "3", "2" and "10" then reverses their indices so "${1}" resolves to "10", "${2}" to "2", "${3}" to "3" and "${4}" to "4" respectively.  When applied to the Replacement Pattern the answer becomes "pool-10-2-3-4.example.com.".</p>
<p id="rfc.section.3.2.2.p.8">EXAMPLE 2 For this example the query is defined as a PTR record for "10.2.3.4" with an origin of "2.10.in-addr.arpa." and the evaluating BULK RR as:</p>
<pre>
- 86400 IN BULK PTR - pool-${*|||3}.example.com.
</pre>
<p id="rfc.section.3.2.2.p.9">This example expands on EXAMPLE 1 with the differences outlined below.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.3.2.2.p.10">The only change to the BULK RR is the Replacement Pattern includes additional fields, specifically null values for delimiter and interval and a padding width of 3.</p>

<p id="rfc.section.4.3.p.1">This document provides a minor yet significant modification to DNSSEC regarding how RRsets will be signed or verified.  Specifically the Signature Field of <a href="#RFC4034" class="xref">[RFC4034]</a>, Section 3.1.8.  Prior to processing into canonical form, signed zones may contain associated RRs where; owner, class and type of a non NPN RR directly corresponds with an NPN RR matching owner, class and Match Type.  If this condition exists the NPN RR's RDATA defines details for processing the associated RDATA into a "Normalized" format.  Normalized data is based on pre-canonical formatting and zero padded for "A" and "AAAA" RR types for acceptable precision during the process.  This concept will become clearer in the NPN pseudocode and examples provided in the sections to follow.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.4.3.p.2">The rules for this transformation are simple:</p>
<p id="rfc.section.4.3.p.3">For RR's Owner field, characters from the beginning to the index of the Owner Ignore value or the final string of characters belonging to the zone's ORIGIN MUST NOT be modified by this algorithm.  While the Owner Ignore value is not used for BULK records but is included with the expectation other pattern-based resource records may emerge and leverage NPN records for their DNSSEC support requirements.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.4.3.p.4">For RR's RDATA field, character from beginning to the index of Left Ignore value or characters with index of Right Ignore value to the end MUST NOT be modified by this algorithm.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.4.3.p.5">In the remaining portion of both Owner and RDATA strings of numeric data, defined as character "0" through "f" or "0" through "9" depending on whether or not the Hexadecimal flag is set or not, MUST be consolidated to a single character and set to the highest value defined by the Hexadecimal flag.  Examples may be found in the following section.  If period-as-number or hyphen-as-number flags are set whichever are used ("." or "-") would be treated as part of the number and consolidated where appropriate.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.4.3.p.6">Once the normalization has been performed the signature will continue processing into canonical form using the normalized RRs in the place of original ones.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.4.3.p.7">One thing to keep in mind when calculating values for the Ignore fields is the Domain Name Pattern and Replacement Pattern fields are considered relative unless terminated by a period.  When processing NPN records the fully-qualified Patterns will be used for determining which characters should be ignored.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.4.3.p.8">NPN RRs MAY be included in the "Additional" section to provide a hint for NPN processing required for verification path.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.4.3.p.9">It is important to note, properly sizing the Ignore fields is critical to minimizing the risk of spoofed signatures.  Never intentionally set all Ignore values to zero in order to make validation easier as it places the validity of zone data at risk. Only accompany RRs which are pattern derived (such as BULK) with NPN records as doing so may unnecessarily reduce the confidence level of generated signatures.</p>

The remaining characters will be processed for numbers between "0" and "f" as indicated by the NPN record's hexadecimal flag "X" and each run replaced by the single character "f".  The final Normalized RDATA would therefore become "fc00::f:f" and its signature would be based on this "normalized" RDATA field. This new "normalized" "AAAA" RR would be used as an RDATA for the wildcard label of "*.example.com." now encompassing all possible permutations of the "fc00::${1}:${2}" pattern.</p>

</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.5.1.p.1">The main side-effect of the BULK RR design is superimposition.  RRs created by the BULK generation process generally rely on the logic of wildcard assignment.  This logic only provides answers where no others exist.  This means in the reverse DNS world (network assignment) HUGE blocks of addresses can be assigned a single BULK record and where delegated to another customer or SWIP will be automatically overridden.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.5.1.p.2">When compared with bind's $GENERATE statement, if a singleton record such as CNAME appears within a $GENERATE range, either the CNAME or $GENERATE becomes invalid.  While a BULK record range would automatically notch out the CNAME without user intervention or creating a potential management problem for the future when two $GENERATES create a hole where the CNAME no longer exists.  BULK RRs would again automatically reassign the missing record to one of its own.</p>

<p id="rfc.section.6.p.1">This section defines known limitations of the BULK resource type.</p>
<h1 id="rfc.section.6.1">
<a href="#rfc.section.6.1">6.1.</a> <a href="#increased-cpu-utilization-for-nxdomain-rrs" id="increased-cpu-utilization-for-nxdomain-rrs">Increased CPU utilization for NXDOMAIN RRs</a>
</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.6.1.p.1">Nameserver requirements to support BULK RRs will minimally increase CPU utilization requirements compared to most RR types.  However, since the inception of DNSSEC more is expected of DNS servers at a system resource level and it is the authors' belief the benefit outweighs the sacrifice.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.6.1.p.2">A quick comparison of BULK versus bind's $GENERATE expansion reveals much more memory would be sacrificed with $GENERATES to save the CPU cycles required to support BULK records.  Additionally, $GENERATES cannot be transferred (i.e. AXFR) without expansion and an IPv6 CIDR even as small as /96 would be simply impossible.  BULK on the other hand can easily support IPv6 CIDRs of /64 and much larger with very little effort.</p>

<a href="#rfc.section.6.2">6.2.</a> <a href="#pre-adoption-nameserver-implications" id="pre-adoption-nameserver-implications">Pre-Adoption Nameserver Implications</a>
</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.6.2.p.1">While there is an added demand on authoritative nameservers, there are no new requirements to recursive (caching) resolvers for non-DNSSEC record handling.  Even authoritative nameservers are able to transfer to and from supporting nameservers with no requirement (although would be unable to return BULK generated records without support).</p>
<p id="rfc.section.6.2.p.2">Prior to widespread adoption on the authoritative side all generated records would be invisible if served on nameservers lacking support. Since generated records are generally NOT service impacting records this should be understood but not of great concern.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.6.2.p.3">Once adoption has reached an appreciable level on the producer (authoritative) side only DNSSEC requirements remain for the consumer (resolver) side.  This behavior is fully expected.</p>
<h1 id="rfc.section.7">
<a href="#rfc.section.7">7.</a> <a href="#security-considerations" id="security-considerations">Security Considerations</a>
</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.7.p.1">Two known security considerations exist for the BULK resource record, DNSSEC and DDOS attack vectors.  Both are addressed in the following sections.</p>
<h1 id="rfc.section.7.1">
<a href="#rfc.section.7.1">7.1.</a> <a href="#dnssec-signature-strategies" id="dnssec-signature-strategies">DNSSEC Signature Strategies</a>
</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.7.1.p.1">DNSSEC was designed to provide verification (validation) for DNS resource records.  In a nutshell this requires each (owner, class, type) tuple to have its own signature.  This essentially defeats the purpose of providing large generated blocks of RRs in a single RR as each generated RR would require its own legitimate RRSIG record.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.7.1.p.2">In the following sections several options are discussed to address this issue.  Of the options, on-the-fly provides the most secure solution and NPN provides the most flexible.</p>
<h1 id="rfc.section.7.1.1">
<a href="#rfc.section.7.1.1">7.1.1.</a> <a href="#on-the-fly-live-signatures" id="on-the-fly-live-signatures">On-the-fly (Live) Signatures</a>
</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.7.1.1.p.1">This solution requires authoritative nameservers to sign generated records <em>as_they_are_generated</em>.  Not all authoritative nameserver implementations offer on-the-fly (realtime) signatures so this solution would either require all implementations to support on-the-fly signing or be ignored by implementations which can not or will not comply.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.7.1.1.p.2">No changes to recursive (resolving) nameservers is required to support this solution.</p>
<h1 id="rfc.section.7.1.2">
<a href="#rfc.section.7.1.2">7.1.2.</a> <a href="#normalized-npn-based-signatures" id="normalized-npn-based-signatures">Normalized (NPN Based) Signatures</a>
</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.7.1.2.p.1">This solution provides the most flexible solution as nameservers without on-the-fly signing capabilities can still support signatures for BULK records.  The down side to this solution is it requires DNSSEC aware recursive (resolving) nameserver support.  Unless a recursive nameserver can verify the signature it is <em>unverifiable</em>.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.7.1.2.p.2">It has been pointed out due to this limitation creation of DNSSEC signed BULK RRs requiring NPN support SHOULD be formally discouraged until such time a respectable percentage (&gt;80) of DNSSEC verification (validation) nameservers "in-the-wild" possess NPN processing capabilities.  Until that time, on-the-fly signing and unsigned BULK records offer the intended capabilities of this document while requiring zero new features to support RR resolution. The authors would like to encourage opening this door for pattern based technologies such as NPN records as a solution to BULK RRs as well as other pattern based RRs to come. Given enough time, enough nameservers will be patched and upgraded for unrelated reasons and by means of simple attrition can supply a level of "inertia" and eventually widespread adoption can be assumed.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.7.1.2.p.3">NPN records are likely to be a topic of great debate as to their own security limitations.  It is, however, the authors' belief; while any logic which limits the input of digital signatures, lessens the validity of such signatures, the limitation is minimal and the gain is significant.  The main reason for this is as a general rule, RRs used in a generic manner such as conventional $GENERATE RRs or scripted mass pattern generated RRs have a lesser importance than other RRs in managed zones.  These therefore inherently pose less risk by means of attack and have a much less reward by defeating security measures.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.7.1.2.p.4">This being said, care must still be taken to set the Ignore fields appropriately to minimize exposure and only use NPN RRs to secure pattern-based records such as BULK.</p>
<h1 id="rfc.section.7.1.3">
<a href="#rfc.section.7.1.3">7.1.3.</a> <a href="#non-dnssec-zone-support-only" id="non-dnssec-zone-support-only">Non-DNSSEC Zone Support Only</a>
</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.7.1.3.p.1">As a final option zones which wish to remain entirely without DNSSEC support may serve such zones without either of the above solutions and records generated based on BULK RRs will require zero support from recursive (resolving) nameservers.</p>
<h1 id="rfc.section.7.2">
<a href="#rfc.section.7.2">7.2.</a> <a href="#dnssec-verifier-details" id="dnssec-verifier-details">DNSSEC Verifier Details</a>
</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.7.2.p.1">Verification of DNSSEC signed BULK generated RRs may be performed against on-the-fly signatures with zero modification to their behavior.  However, verification against NPN records would require changes to the logic to incorporate processing RDATA generated by BULK logic as described above so the results will be compatible.</p>
<h1 id="rfc.section.7.3">
<a href="#rfc.section.7.3">7.3.</a> <a href="#ddos-attack-vectors-and-mitigation" id="ddos-attack-vectors-and-mitigation">DDOS Attack Vectors and Mitigation</a>
</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.7.3.p.1">As an additional defense against Distributed Denial Of Service (DDOS) attacks against recursive (resolving) nameservers it is highly recommended shorter TTLs be used for BULK RRs than others.  While disabling caching with a zero TTL is not recommended (as this would only result in a shift of the attack target) a balance will need to be found.  While this document uses 24 hours (86400) in its examples values between 300 to 900 are likely more appropriate and is RECOMMENDED.  What is ultimately deemed appropriate may differ from zone to zone and administrator to administrator.</p>
<h1 id="rfc.section.7.4">
<a href="#rfc.section.7.4">7.4.</a> <a href="#implications-of-large-scale-dns-records" id="implications-of-large-scale-dns-records">Implications of Large Scale DNS Records</a>
</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.7.4.p.1">The production of such large scale "records in the wild" may have some unintended side-effects.  These side-effects could be of concern or add unexpected complications to DNS based security offerings or forensic and anti-spam measures.  While outside the scope of this document, implementers of technology relying on DNS resource records for critical decision making must take into consideration how the existence of such a volume of records might impact their technology.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.7.4.p.2">Solutions to the "magnitude" problem for BULK generated RRs are expected be similar if not identical to that of existing wildcard records, the core difference being the resultant RDATA will be unique for each requested Domain Name within its scope.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.7.4.p.3">The authors of this document are confident that by careful consideration, <em>negative_side-effects</em> produced by implementing the features described in this document <em>can_be_eliminated</em> from any such service or product.</p>
